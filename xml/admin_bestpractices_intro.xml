  <title>Reporting Software Problems</title>

  <para>
   If you come across a problem when running &productname; &productnumber; related to some of its
   components, such as &ceph;, &rgw;, or Calamari, report the problem to SUSE
   Technical Support. The recommended way is with the
   <command>supportconfig</command> utility.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <para>
    Because <command>supportconfig</command> is modular software, make sure
    that the <systemitem>supportutils-plugin-ses</systemitem> package is
    installed.
   </para>
<screen>rpm -q supportutils-plugin-ses</screen>
   <para>
    If it is missing on the &ceph; server, install it with
   </para>
<screen>zypper ref &amp;&amp; zypper in supportutils-plugin-ses</screen>
  </tip>

  <para>
   Although you can use <command>supportconfig</command> on the command line,
   we recommend using the related &yast; module. Find more information about
   <command>supportconfig</command> in
